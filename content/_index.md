# About Interlibr

[Interlibr](https://github.com/Xalgorithms/interlibr) is a cloud-based,
table-driven computing platform for [interpreting computational
rules](/concepts/on.rule.systems). It is built on a domain-specific language
called [Xalgo](/language/xalgo). An [online interpreter](/language/interpreter)
of the language serves as the kernel of a [cloud-deployed service
platform](/architecture/core.architecture).

# About Xalgorithms Alliance

Some of the stakeholders in the development of the platform are members of the
[Xalgorithms Alliance](https://www.xalgorithms.org/). This collective shares
common goals related to the automation of externally-managed computational
rules.
