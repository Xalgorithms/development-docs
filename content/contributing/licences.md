Xalgorithms Alliance aligns with both the demand-side perspective of
The Free Software Definition (i.e. user freedoms), and the supply-side
perspective of The Open Source Software Definition (i.e. developer
methodologies).

The intellectual rights section of the [Xalgorithms Alliance Accession
Agreement](https://www.xalgorithms.org/about-us/membership/) (XAAA) is
adapted from the [Fedora Project Contributor Agreement, Version
2015-02-03](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Legal:Fedora_Project_Contributor_Agreement?rd=Legal:FPCA)
Our common objective is to ensure that contributions have the desired
free/libre/open licensing terms without requiring intellectual rights
assignment.

In summary, when a committer submits an unlicensed contribution to
this project, Xalgorithms Alliance relies on the following default
licenses:

* [Apache 2.0 or a more recent version](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)
* [GNU GPL 3.0 or a more recent version](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html)
* [LGPL 3.0 or a more recent version](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html)
* [CC-by 4.0 or a more recent version](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)

The first three licenses in this list include explicit non-aggression
clauses relating to statutory monopolies over ideas
(i.e. "patents"). Occassionally Xalgorithms Foundation may post
[defensive publications](http://www.defensivepublications.org/) to
pre-empt the imposition of such monopolies.

On an ad hoc basis, other free/libre/open source licenses may
additionally be used by Xalgorithms Foundation in combination with the
default licenses, to accommodate certain participation requirements
other organizations, or to meet particular business objectives of the
Alliance which are not fully accommodated in the above licenses.

In order to make the Lichen component readily adaptable to any
deployment environment, it is being provided with two distribution
streams from the outset:

* OpenLichen will comprise the core elements of the system, to be
  distributed under the permissive Apache License (AL) version 2.0
  license, or a more recent version of it.
* FreeLichen will be a feature-rich derivative of OpenLichen, to be
  distributed under the unified GNU General Public License (GPL)
  version 3.0, or a more recent version of it.
