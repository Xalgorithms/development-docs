# Context

In the spring of 2020, we attempted to finish the [latest
version](https://github.com/orgs/Xalgorithms/projects/8) of the the Xalgo
language. We brought in some new collaborators that brought a different
perspective on how to do _table-based programming_. This lead us to start to
reconsider the capabilities of the language and even the scope of the
language. It was proposed that Xalgo could be _far simpler_ than it is. It might
even be possible to express what we needed to express in a set of
_spreadsheet-like tables_, rather than in a textual programming language. This
experiment is designed to test the results of those conversations.
