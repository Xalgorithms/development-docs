During the development of Interlibr, we have to think through some fairly
complicated problems. Normally, we'd get together and sit in a nice pub patio to
has out the concepts associated with a problem. Since the team working on
Interlibr is geographically dispersed, we have had to come up with a different
approach. Instead of meeting, we come up with example cases that exercise some
or all of the functionality of the platform. We try to inject a _tiny bit of
formalism_ in the hope that future readers will have enough context to
understand the problem by reading it. If there is a rare case where external
references are required, they'll be linked from the problem itself. We find that
this approach helps improve the asynchronous capability of the team - each of
use can assess the problem and respond on their own time.

The solutions to the problems or the decisions that we've made in light of the
problem may or may not get recorded in the problem statement. We try to remember
to reference the problem in GitHub issues or code comments, where applicable.
