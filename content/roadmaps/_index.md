On a regular cadence, the contributors to Interlibr convene to figure out where
we're headed. We capture what we decide to do using a [particular
proceduralism](changes.md) within GitHub projects. The results of this
discussion are captured in the
[projects](https://github.com/orgs/Xalgorithms/projects/) and prioritized in the
[project-of-projects](https://github.com/orgs/Xalgorithms/projects/16). The
rationale behind the decisions and other detrius of discussion are kept here.
