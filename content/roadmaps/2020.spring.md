# Goals

Throughout the past Fall and Winter, development work has _slept_. In this time
of renewal, we have a few projects that we hope to complete:

- [Xalgo/3](https://github.com/orgs/Xalgorithms/projects/8): Experimentation
  with the language has shown that some necessary things are missing. Changing
  the language offers a foundation for renewal.
- [Consistent deployment](https://github.com/orgs/Xalgorithms/projects/14): The
  tools for getting an environment running are messy and
  disorganized. Spring-cleaning is required to inspire contributors.
