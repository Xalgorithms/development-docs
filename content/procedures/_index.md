Interlibr (and related) projects are implemented by a collective of *individual
contributors* each of whom add functionality to the solution on their own
terms. Organizationally, features are *desired* and *prioritized* but each
contributor chooses what they would like to contribute. Due to these factors,
the *development process* exists to make each individual's contributions visible
and apparent. We strive to give credit where credit is due.

Conversely, from an organizational perspective, we need to be able to trace the
motiviation for any changes to the solution. The *why* of a change need to be
readily apparent so that the core team can determine whether a change is suited
to the solution (and thus approved a pull request). Of equal importance is the
*what* of change. The core team needs to be able to identify the effect of a
change.

To have a little more flexibility in editing or potentially moving the project,
the collective maintains this documentation in revisioned markdown files rather
than the Github wiki.
