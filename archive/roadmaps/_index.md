On a regular cadence, the contributors to Interlibr convene to figure out where
we're headed. We capture what we decide to do using a [particular
proceduralism](../contributing/changes) within GitHub projects. The results
of this discussion are captured in the
[projects](https://github.com/orgs/Xalgorithms/projects/) and prioritized in the
[project-of-projects](https://github.com/orgs/Xalgorithms/projects/16). The
rationale behind the decisions and other detrius of discussion are kept here.

Traditionally, the simple forward progress of life is measured according to the
seasons. Each persons rhythms follow these seasons. Spring is a time for renewal
and planting. Fall brings a harvest following by a relaxation. The developers of
these projects take inspiration from this simple idea and plan their work
_seasonally_.
